## Fitness Tracker and Exercise Classifier

### Introduction
Welcome to the 'Fitness Tracker and Exercise Classifier' project. This repository is dedicated to developing sophisticated Python scripts for processing, visualizing, and modeling data from fitness tracking sensors, specifically accelerometers and gyroscopes. Our primary objective is to build a machine learning model that can classify various fitness activities and accurately count repetitions.

### Project Goal
Our goal is to harness data science and machine learning to interpret sensor data from fitness activities. By analyzing accelerometer and gyroscope data, this project aims to create a model that classifies different fitness exercises and counts exercise repetitions with high precision.

### Key Features
- **Quantified Self & MetaMotion Sensor**: Utilizes cutting-edge sensors for accurate fitness activity tracking.
- **Data Processing**: Focuses on converting raw sensor data into a structured format, ensuring data integrity.
- **Visual Analytics**: Employs time-series and other visualizations to interpret sensor data effectively.
- **Advanced Outlier Detection**: Implements sophisticated methods like Chauvenetâ€™s criterion and local outlier factor for data refinement.
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes techniques like frequency analysis, low pass filtering, PCA, and clustering to enhance model inputs.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Leverages various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVMs, Random Forest, and Neural Networks for exercise classification.
- **Exceptional Accuracy**: Demonstrates over 99% accuracy in classifying exercises and counting repetitions.
